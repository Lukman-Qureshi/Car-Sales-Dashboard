Power Bi Car Sales Interactive Dashboard
🚗 Power BI Project: Car Sales Dashboard 📊
Excited to share my latest data analytics project—an interactive Car Sales Dashboard built in Power BI, showcasing advanced Time Intelligence capabilities.
This dashboard delivers actionable insights across multiple dimensions:
•	📅 YTD & MTD Total Sales for performance tracking
•	📈 YTD Weekly Sales Trend to monitor momentum
•	🎨 Sales by Car Colour & Body Style for customer preference analysis
•	🏪 Dealer-wise Sales Breakdown to evaluate channel performance
•	🏢 Company-wise Sales Trend for competitive benchmarking
From data modelling to DAX measures, this project reflects my ability to turn raw data into meaningful business insights. It’s a step forward in my journey toward becoming a Data Analyst/Data Scientist, and I’m eager to apply these skills in real-world scenarios.
🔍 Looking forward to connecting with professionals in analytics, SaaS, and data-driven product development. Feedback and opportunities are always welcome!
